                    My coding journey began back in 6th grade, when I got curious about how Discord bots worked. What started as simple tinkering quickly turned into a passion for programming. Around the same time, I was also learning After Effects through gaming edits, which taught me creativity, design sense, and the patience to bring ideas to life.

                    That early spark grew into a deeper fascination with how machines can actually learn and possess knowledge through AI and ML. Today, that curiosity has evolved into expertise I now work across both full-stack development and AI/ML, blending creativity, logic, and innovation to build impactful projects.

                    On the full-stack side, I specialize in the MERN stack building dynamic, responsive web applications. On the AI/ML side, I work extensively with TensorFlow for deep learning, scikit-learn for classical machine learning, and frameworks like LangChain for building intelligent applications that leverage natural language understanding. Iâ€™m also experienced in RAG pipelines and vector search, enabling AI systems to retrieve and reason over large amounts of information efficiently.
